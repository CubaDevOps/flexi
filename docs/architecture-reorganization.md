# Architecture Reorganization - Clean Architecture and CQRS

## Summary of Implemented Changes

### 1. New Directory Structure

The following structures have been created following Clean Architecture:

```
src/
├── Domain/
│   ├── Events/                    # ← NEW: Domain events
│   ├── Services/                  # ← NEW: Pure domain services
│   └── (maintains Entities, ValueObjects, Interfaces, Exceptions, etc.)
│
├── Application/
│   ├── Commands/                  # ← NEW: CQRS Commands
│   ├── Queries/                   # ← NEW: CQRS Queries
│   ├── DTO/                       # ← NEW: Application DTOs
│   └── (maintains UseCase, EventListeners)
│
└── Infrastructure/
    └── (maintains Bus, Cache, Controllers, etc.)
```

### 2. Class Movements Performed

#### A. DTOs Moved to Application Layer (CQRS)

**Commands:**
- `Domain/DTO/CommandListDTO.php` → `Application/Commands/ListCommandsCommand.php`

**Queries:**
- `Domain/DTO/QueryListDTO.php` → `Application/Queries/ListQueriesQuery.php`
- `Domain/DTO/EmptyVersionDTO.php` → `Application/Queries/GetVersionQuery.php`

**Justification:** These DTOs are specific to application use cases (commands and queries), they are not part of the pure domain. They correctly follow the CQRS pattern.

#### B. Domain Events Moved

**From `Domain/Classes/` to `Domain/Events/`:**
- `Event.php` → `Domain/Events/Event.php`
- `EventListener.php` → `Domain/Events/EventListener.php`

**Justification:** Events are domain concepts but deserve their own namespace for clarity and separation of concerns.

#### C. Template Moved to Infrastructure

**From `Domain/Classes/` to `Infrastructure/Ui/`:**
- `Template.php` → `Infrastructure/Ui/Template.php`

**Justification:** Template handles file I/O (file_exists, pathinfo, etc.), which is an infrastructure concern, not domain.

### 3. Classes Remaining in Domain/DTO

The following classes remain in `Domain/DTO/` because they are shared utilities:

- **DummyDTO.php** - Base DTO for testing and special cases
- **NotFoundCliCommand.php** - Null Object pattern used by buses

### 4. Import Updates

All imports were updated in the following files:

**Application Layer:**
- `Application/UseCase/ListCommands.php` - Now uses `ListCommandsCommand`
- `Application/UseCase/ListQueries.php` - Now uses `ListQueriesQuery`
- `Application/EventListeners/LoggerEventListener.php` - Now uses `Domain\Events\EventListener`

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- `Infrastructure/Controllers/HealthController.php` - Now uses `GetVersionQuery`
- `Infrastructure/Controllers/NotFoundController.php` - Now uses `Infrastructure\Ui\Template`
- `Infrastructure/Controllers/WebHookController.php` - Now uses `Domain\Events\Event`
- `Infrastructure/Bus/CommandBus.php` - Now uses `Domain\Events\Event`
- `Infrastructure/Bus/QueryBus.php` - Now uses `Domain\Events\Event`
- `Infrastructure/Http/Router.php` - Now uses `Domain\Events\Event`
- `Infrastructure/Ui/HtmlRender.php` - Now uses the new Template location
- `Infrastructure/Ui/Cli/EventHandler.php` - Now uses `Domain\Events\Event`

**Domain Interfaces:**
- `Domain/Interfaces/TemplateEngineInterface.php` - Now uses `Infrastructure\Ui\Template`

### 5. Updated Configuration Files

**src/Config/queries.json:**
```json
{
  "handlers": [
    {
      "id": "CubaDevOps\\Flexi\\Application\\Queries\\GetVersionQuery",
      "cli_alias": "version",
      "handler": "CubaDevOps\\Flexi\\Application\\UseCase\\Health"
    },
    {
      "id": "CubaDevOps\\Flexi\\Application\\Queries\\ListQueriesQuery",
      "cli_alias": "query:list",
      "handler": "CubaDevOps\\Flexi\\Application\\UseCase\\ListQueries"
    },
    {
      "id": "CubaDevOps\\Flexi\\Application\\Commands\\ListCommandsCommand",
      "cli_alias": "command:list",
      "handler": "CubaDevOps\\Flexi\\Application\\UseCase\\ListCommands"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Applied Clean Architecture Principles

✅ **Dependency Rule Respected:**
- Domain does NOT depend on Application or Infrastructure
- Application orchestrates Domain using its interfaces
- Infrastructure implements interfaces defined in Domain

✅ **Separation of Concerns:**
- Application DTOs (Commands/Queries) → Application layer
- Domain events → Domain/Events
- I/O concerns (Template) → Infrastructure

✅ **CQRS Implemented:**
- Commands clearly separated in Application/Commands
- Queries clearly separated in Application/Queries
- Consistent nomenclature: *Command for commands, *Query for queries

### 7. Recommended Next Steps

The following classes in `Domain/Classes/` still need review to determine their correct location:

1. **Collection.php, ObjectCollection.php**
   - Consider moving to `Domain/Collections/` or evaluate if they are truly Aggregates

2. **Route.php**
   - Consider moving to `Infrastructure/Http/Route.php` (it's an HTTP concern)

3. **Service.php, ServiceClassDefinition.php, ServiceFactoryDefinition.php**
   - Consider moving to `Infrastructure/DependencyInjection/` (these are DI concerns)

4. **Log.php**
   - Evaluate if it should be in `Domain/Entities/` or `Domain/Services/`

5. **PlainTextMessage.php**
   - Evaluate if it should be in `Domain/ValueObjects/` or `Infrastructure/`

### 8. New Files Created

- `src/Application/Commands/ListCommandsCommand.php`
- `src/Application/Queries/ListQueriesQuery.php`
- `src/Application/Queries/GetVersionQuery.php`
- `src/Domain/Events/Event.php`
- `src/Domain/Events/EventListener.php`
- `src/Infrastructure/Ui/Template.php`

### 9. Important Notes

⚠️ **Original files in Domain/Classes and Domain/DTO still exist.**
Recommended:

1. Run tests to verify everything works correctly
2. Delete old files once migration is confirmed successful
3. Update tests that reference old locations

⚠️ **Tests that need updating:**

- `tests/Domain/Classes/EventTest.php`
- `tests/Domain/Classes/TemplateTest.php`
- `tests/Domain/Classes/HtmlRenderTest.php`
- `tests/Infrastructure/Controllers/WebHookControllerTest.php`

### 10. Benefits of This Reorganization

✅ **Architectural clarity**: Each layer has well-defined responsibilities
✅ **Explicit CQRS**: Commands and queries clearly separated
✅ **Improved testability**: Clearer and separated dependencies
✅ **Maintainability**: Structure easier to understand and navigate
✅ **Scalability**: Solid foundation for adding new features
✅ **Compliance with SOLID principles and Clean Architecture**
